    <h1>Investment Portfolio Tracker:</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This Python-based project is designed to track the performance of various investments over time. It can be
            developed to manage stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other types of investments. Integrating it with a
            financial API can provide real-time or historical market data. Storing and processing data from these
            investments could be handled using a database like SQLite, and libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn can
            be used to generate graphs and charts for data visualization. This project can serve as an efficient tool to
            understand how financial markets work and how to analyze data in Python.</p>

    <h2>3D Treasury Yield Curve Contour Map:</h2>
        <p>This Python-based project involves creating a 3D contour map of the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve. Using data from the U.S.
            Department of the Treasury, this application visualizes the yield curve across different maturities and dates. The
            project could utilize libraries like NumPy for numerical computations, pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib or
            Plotly for the creation of 3D visualizations. This project serves as a way to understand financial concepts while
            practicing data manipulation and visualization in Python.
